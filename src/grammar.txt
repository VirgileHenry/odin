# Grammar for Magic: the gathering.
# termials are written in min "card".
# non terminals are written in maj, "OBJECT".
# rules are given by NON_TERMINAL: \n rule1 \n rule2,
# with rules being NON_TERM term NONE_TERM_2.
# terminals are grouped up under a single non term that define them. This help the rust impl.
# non terminals are also under enums, 
# terminals may have their actual syntax written in parenthesis.
# non-terminal 'TEXT' is the entry point.
